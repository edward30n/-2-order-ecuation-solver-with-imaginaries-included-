# -2-order-ecuation-solver-with-imaginaries-included-
Purpuse: 

* This program is made to solve ecuations of second order compiled in cmd with gcc.

   files:
   
      * main.c:                     Contains the full code of the program.
      * edwardduarte_tarea02.docx:  Contains the comprobation of the correct answers with some examples.

   How to run:

      * To Use the code you have to compile it in cmd with the following command (you must have the gcc program installed in you pc) : "gcc main.c -o eject.exe". 
      * Then, you can run the ejecutable with the following command: "eject.exe 5 4 3", where 5 refers to the number of x^2, 4 the number of x, and 3 the number of the constant in the ecuation.
      * You will get the solution with the imaginary numbers.
